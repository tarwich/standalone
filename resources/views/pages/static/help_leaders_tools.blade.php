<h1>Website Tools for Community Leaders</h1>

<p>Several website tools are available for the Community Leaders:
    Edit member data, review team lists, view service lists, and send unmoderated communication.</p>

<p>As a Leader, you can <strong>edit community members</strong> information
    by going to the person's name in the roster, and opening their page. At the top of the
    page you will see a button to "Edit" the data. You can
    change the addresses, phone numbers or e-mail addresses for the members
    in the entire community. As you find out about changes, say, as the Rector
    makes contact with community members and passes the information to you,
    you can make the updates as needed. The preference would
    be for the individual to make the changes themselves, but you can serve as a
    backup to that if needed.</p>

<p>When editing a community member, note that you can mark them as "Active" or "Inactive".
    "Active" status puts people on the Community Directory page. If that is unchecked
    (makes them inactive) then that person no longer shows up on the directory. Making someone
    inactive also removes them from the list that the Rector uses to make up a team.

    There is a list, accessible from your home/dashboard page, that
    shows everyone that is inactive. What makes someone <strong>inactive</strong>?
    They may have informed us that they no longer wish to serve or be notified of community information.
    Or, it could mean that a Leaders person has determined this is
    someone who has not shown any interest or participation in
    the community (ie. not served on a team, not attended Secuela,
    not sent any palanca, not logged onto the website, etc.) for at least several years.
    It is recommended that you take a look at the existing inactive list to ensure that no one
    is mistakenly there.</p>

<p>Once the rector forms the team and marks people as Confirmed, and releases the team for viewing, everyone will be able to see it.
    This is available from the weekends page, by clicking the Team Roster button.
    The Men's/Women's Leader, and community President, may also View the "unconfirmed" team roster,
    just like the Rector does, by clicking the Edit Roster button lower on the Weekend page.
    This will allow you as the Leaders person to review the proposed team as the
    Rector works on it and provide a means of sharing that information for discussion.</p>

<p>Another way the Leaders position can assist the Rector is by reviewing the <strong>service records</strong> for the community.
    This list is available from the main dashboard as the "Leaders Worksheet" and "Members Interested in Serving" report.
</p>

<p>You have the option to <strong>edit the past service records</strong> by updating the team roster of any team
    <strong>for two weeks </strong>after a weekend ends.
    You may want to make corrections in case a person was listed in the incorrect position on
    the team (or may have been a last minute addition or cancellation and was not updated online
    by the rector). Just select the weekend of the team that needs to be corrected and
    click on the "Edit Team" button. Rectors also have the ability to edit the team composition
    (of their weekend only) at any time until two weeks after their weekend ends.</p>

<p>You also may send <strong>email communication to the community</strong> (unmoderated).
    The "compose" screen allows you to enter the subject and text of the e-mail,
    and choose several e-mail options, such as women-only, or secuela-specific notices.
    Please choose appropriately so that we respect members' chosen email preferences.</p>
