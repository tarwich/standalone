                        <p>Palanca is introduced and General Palanca letters are read during the Holy Spirit Rollo on Friday afternoon. It is called a "general" Palanca letter because it is one letter written to all candidates as a whole. A few of these letters are chosen and read aloud during this Rollo. Then all of the letters are posted on the Rollo room wall for the candidates to read. Rollistas and Table Assistants should not write a General Palanca Letter.</p>

                        <p>Dear Brothers/Sisters in Christ,</p>
                        <p>What a delight it is to be able to serve you on this Tres Dias weekend.  I am honored that God would allow me this privilege.</p>
                        <p>It is a joy to watch our Father at work in all of your lives as He touches you with His love.  It has been my prayer for many weeks that His perfect will would be accomplished in you during this Tres Dias weekend.  I trust that He has prepared your hearts to receive all that He has planned for you during these three days.  Be open to Him.  Receive His love.  Yield your will to His will that you may be made perfect in Christ.</p>
                        <p>As the weekend progresses, you will see more and more just how much you are loved by God and by all of us who are serving Him by serving you.  We are here for one reason: that you might experience His love in a greater dimension than you have ever, known before.</p>
                        <p>To God be all glory and honor and power forever.</p>
                        <p>In Jesus' love,</p>
                        <p>(Your signature)<br>(Your team position)</p>
