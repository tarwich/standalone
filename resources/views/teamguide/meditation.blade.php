        <h2>Meditation</h2>

<p>We invite you Holy Spirit, to open our hearts and minds to Your limitless love, grace and wisdom.</p>

<p>May we learn to trust in Your power, and Your Life within us, that we may be truly wise, always rejoicing in Your comfort and provision, through Christ our Lord.
  Amen.</p>

<p>I believe, Lord, that You are here present. Though my eyes do not see You, my heart senses You. Take any stray thoughts from my mind. Help me understand the truths that You wish to teach me. I ask You for the courage
  and power to put them into practice. I am listening; speak, O Lord, to my soul.</p>

<p>We give thanks Lord Jesus, for who You are and your perfect work of redemption in us. Glory and honour to You, the same yesterday, today and forever.
  Amen.</p>
