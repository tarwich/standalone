<H2>Purpose of Team Meetings</H2>

<P><i>Your commitment to serve on a this Tres Dias weekend begins now!</i> We will meet several times prior to our
    weekend to prepare both practically and spiritually to fulfill our purpose of glorifying Jesus Christ and sharing
    His love with the candidates...and one another.
<P>Team meetings will allow us time to get to know fellow team members, as well as to learn what is expected of us in
    each of our service areas during the weekend. Each team member is an important part of Christ's body, with a
    specific task to fulfill. At team meetings we learn how to do our jobs!
<P>We also learn the parameters of our service. We are expected to submit to the direction and authority of our Section
    Heads. Each Section Head is expected to serve under the direction and authority of our Rector.
<P><B>Team meetings are also for the purpose of getting in touch with our own lives and our own issues. There are
        Spiritual Directors at each meeting to serve us and help us with whatever is on our minds. They take time out of
        their busy schedules to be available to minister to us. PLEASE take these times at team meetings to get your
        heart prepared for the weekend. Remember that though we are always blessed tremendously on every Tres Dias
        weekend, the weekend itself is primarily a time for the Candidates. We must be willing and ready to put
        ourselves aside for them.</B>
<P>Team meetings are a time for worship and communion among us. A time to be with a unique group of brothers, set apart,
    spending time with our Lord and creating memories with each other. God has called you for such a time as this.
<P>Let's make every effort to be obedient to the Lord, to be fervent in prayer, to honor our commitment, to arrive on
    time, to respect the leaders placed over us, and to allow Jesus to demonstrate His servant's heart through us! May
    you be blessed as we learn ""
