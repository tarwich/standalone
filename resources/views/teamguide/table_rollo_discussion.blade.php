                <h3>Discussing a Rollo At The Table On A Weekend</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your table group, at the beginning, will consist of up to six individuals. As with any new group of people, there will be a tendency for everyone to try to "size up" one another. Consequently, don't expect too much from the early rollo discussions. It will take time for the table to come together. You can risk the desired outcome by trying to rush things or push someone faster than they are are ready to go. Give God a chance to work at the table. What usually happens after the Ideal rollo has been given is that everyone at the table kind of looks at everyone else to see who is going to start. So, solve the problem and <strong>YOU</strong> be the one to begin. Open with a question that will require a statement as an answer such as "What did you get out of that?" or "What do you think?"</li>
                    <li>As the talks progress, be sure that everyone at the table is brought into the discussion. Some people won't need help. Some will talk too much. Others will never respond unless <strong>YOU</strong> bring them in: "Charles, you seem deep in thought, what do you think?"</li>
                    <li>As a table leader, you do need to evaluate how things are going with each person, but do not judge the person. You may have someone at a table who is truly behaving in in an obnoxious way. You need to love that person and pray for that person (and yourself) more than anyone else. There is a danger that you may exclude someone at the table who is difficult to like.</li>
                    <li>As much as you can, compliment each person who contributes something to the discussion: "Jim, that was a really good explanation", or "Mary, I hadn't seen it that way, I appreciate your ideas", or "Bill, that was interesting". By doing this, you will be telling each person that their ideas are okay, they're on track, you approve. The approval will help all of them to get bolder and offer even more thoughts. Everybody has thoughts and opinions on everything: the goal is to get them to express them. Remember that in order to give an opinion, the person giving it is running the risk of being rejected and maybe even embarrassed by the group. Many people have never encountered anything but criticism from family and friends whenever they have tried to express what they think or feel and so have adopted an attitude of "no more". If you find it difficult to see the value in what was offered, remember what you are really approving and reinforcing is the willingness to try, to risk.</li>
                    <li>Don't let silence at the table scare you. There is nothing wrong with some time to reflect before speaking. Also, silence can be a tool that you can use. Instead of leading off as usual with a question, just sit back and stare into your notebook and wait. People don't like silence. It's very uncomfortable. Somebody will break the silence: which is what you want - to get the others talking. Use your table partner. Ask your table partner leading questions as a way to get others into the conversation. You may want to say something that you know people will disagree with just to get different points of view or to get folks talking.</li>
                    <li>Above all, be yourself. You will be a key in creating an atmosphere of love, joy, and God's peace. Enjoy this position.</li>
                </ul>
