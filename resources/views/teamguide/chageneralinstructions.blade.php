                <h3>General Weekend Instructions for Chas</h3>

<P>You are there to serve. Candidates should never get anything for themselves nor go off by themselves except during
    breaks, but be sensitive; someone may just need some space.
<P>Your service area head should always know where you are. Do not get "lost". You are on a team and you should assist
    other team members (especially in your section) when needed. If your work is done and your Section Head agrees for
    you to take some time off, agree on a time to return and honor that time limit. Because of the limited space in the
    Rollo room and Chapel, non-essential team members are asked not to enter during proceedings.
<P>Remember to use your chain of command. All Chas are under the authority of their Section Heads, then the Assistant
    Head Chas, or the Head Cha, and then the Rector or Backup Rector. Please respect and submit to the leadership. If
    there are problems that come up which you cannot handle, go to your section head. If he cannot handle it, he will go
    to the Assistant Head Cha. Only the Assistant Head Chas, or the Head Cha will talk to the campground administrator.
    NEVER make decisions about your service area apart from your section head.
<P>All Chas are to be at the Thursday night reception. Please do not use any Tres Dias terms, wear your Tres Dias cross,
    or hug anyone at the reception. You will be introduced to the Candidates. Please give your name and service area
    only. Palanca Chas will be introduced as "Special Chas".
<P>This is a cloistered weekend:
<UL>
    <li>Leave personal concerns and work behind.
    <LI>Do not leave the campground for any reason during the weekend unless asked to do so by the Rector, Head Cha, or
        Assistant Head Cha.
    <LI>Only team members are allowed on the Campground except for scheduled events (weekend photo, serenade, closing,
        takedown) or emergencies.
    <li>Please respect the confidentiality of the Tres Dias Weekend.
</UL>
<P>Be sure your Section Head is aware of your being pulled for Prayer Palanca.
<P>We want Candidates to use restrooms at the appropriate times, but don't make a big deal about it if someone needs to
    go at an unscheduled time.
<P>Please do not hug candidates or team members until after the Saturday morning chapel when the "abrazzo" is introduced
    to the Candidates. This includes arms around one another at meals during the singing of "Grace" and "Thanks".
<P>Have your service area packed and clean before going to Closing on Sunday.
<P>All Chas, except Chapel Chas, should line the halls, stairs, pathways, etc. whenever candidates move from place to
    place. If it is dark, bring a flashlight with you.
<P>Do not ask special favors of other Chas. We all have a lot to do!
<P>You may wear your Tres Dias cross on Saturday morning after the Friday Piety Rollo.
<P>Be an example for the candidates-when the bell rings, respond quickly; be silent during the spiritual retreat and be
    quiet and meditative in the chapel.
