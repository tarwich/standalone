<P><U>Clergy Talks</U>
<UL>
    <P>The first clergy talk, <U>Grace</U>, defines the Christian ideal to be the Life in Grace. It further defines Life in Grace to be a personal relationship with God.
    <P>The remaining clergy talks explore ways of strengthening that relationship.
    <P>One way of looking at the clergy talks is to group them into talks concerned with living in grace and talks concerned with overcoming difficulties and barriers to a fuller life in Grace:
    <UL>
        <P>Living in Grace
        <UL>
            <li>Grace (Friday)
            <li>Sacred Moments of Grace (Saturday)
            <li>Life in Grace (Sunday)
        </UL>
        <P>Aids to a Fuller Life in Grace
        <UL>
            <li>Divine Aid and the Holy Spirit (Friday)
            <li>Obstacles to a Life in Grace (Saturday)
            <li>Fourth Day* (Sunday)
        </UL>
    </UL>
    <P>* Although the Fourth Day talk is usually given by a Layman, it is logically grouped with the clergy talks because it deals with overcoming obstacles to perseverance in the Life in Grace. This leaves nine talks - three each day - to the "Lay Talks" category.
</UL>
<P><U>Lay Talks</U>
<UL>
    <P>The talks of the first day are personal and introspective, growing toward the third day talks, which are of a communinal nature.
    <P>The level of personal testimony, witness, and evangelism in each talk increases during each day. The first talk each day is basically intellectual, and the final talk of the day is a personal witness talk.
    <P>The first talk of the day appeals to the mind, or intellect; the second to the will; and the third to the heart. Stated another way, the first talks deals with understanding, the second talks deal with commitment, and the third talks deal with love. The weekend must come to each candidate at all three levels.

    <P>The relationships depicted in this chart are not absolute, but they indicate the trend of talks on the Tres Dias weekend. "A Little Witness" does not mean "no personal references", and "A lot of Witness" does not mean "forget the outline". The Piety talk is the first "heavy witness" talk and therefore its witness is very important; however, the Leaders and Security talks will normally contain as much (or even more) personal witness than Piety. Study and Environment are "head" talks like Ideal, but they can contain such things as introductory prayer and personal views on religion, whch are normally excluded from Ideal.
    <P>Each talk outline identifies the points to be made in each talk, and the general approach to the talk; however, each talk must be a personal sharing the rollista and each candidate, not a recitation. Therefore, the primary job of the rollista is to relate the talk outline to his own life, whether on an intellectual level (the first talk) or on an emotional level (third talk), in such a way that the candidate understands what the subject of the talk means to the rollista.
    <P>The opening talks and the meditations consider both the person and his need of conversion and Christ Himself. They start to sketch Christ's character, especially His love. They stress the need for self-examination and full response; idealism built on the willingness to believe that something great is possible; and self-surrender or dedication - the willingness to put everything possible into Christ's work in the spirit of charity, concern for God and for other men. From this point on, the candidate is never allowed to forget that he is face-to-face with Christ, who is looking at him and asking something of him, and that he has to respond to Christ fully and unreservedly.
