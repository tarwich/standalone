        <h2>Meditation</h2>

        <p>Come Holy Spirit, fill our hearts and kindle them in the fire of your love. Send forth Your Spirit and they shall be created.</p>
        <p>And You shall renew the face of the earth.</p>
        <p>O God, who by the light of the Holy Spirit instructs the hearts of the faithful, grant that by the same Holy Spirit we may be truly wise and ever rejoice in His consolation, through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
        <p>I believe, Lord, that You are here present, although my eyes do not see You, my faith senses You. Take any stray thoughts from my mind. Make me understand the truths that You wish to teach me in this
          meditation. Let me make up my mind to put them into practice. Your servant is listening; speak O Lord to my soul.</p>
        <p>We give thanks, Lord God Almighty, for all the benefits You have given us. To You Who live and reign forever and ever. Amen.</p>
