<h4>Introduction</h4>
<P>Congratulations!  After prayerful consideration, you have been invited to serve on the team for a Tres Dias weekend!  Before accepting your position on the team, you examined your responsibilities to God, family, church, and work.  Your commitment to serve covers a period of about two months from the first team meeting until the weekend.  You can be assured God ordained your participation and will bring great blessing to those you serve and to yourself as well.  You can also expect opposition from the enemy.  The greater the battle, the greater the work that will be accomplished.  You are participating in a life-changing event for yourself, the team, and the candidates.

<h4>Shared Tasks</h4>
<P>The Rector has asked you to fulfill a specific assignment on this team.  Each team member is an important part of Christ's body, with a specific task to do.
<P><i>"If one part of the body suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it." (I Corinthians. 12:26)</i>
<P>A Tres Dias weekend is a wonderful example of the Body of Christ working toward a common purpose - to glorify God.  The weekend is the most effective instrument of His grace when each task is performed under the leadership of the Rector and with the heart and hands of Christ.  Although a team member receives ministry and blessings during this time of service, the weekend and its activities are centered on the candidates.  While each team member has a unique role to fulfill, there are some tasks that are shared.  These shared tasks can be divided into three categories:
<OL>
    <LI>Team Building - Preparing for the Weekend
    <LI>Participating in the Weekend
    <LI>Celebrating the Weekend
</OL>

<h4>Team Building - Preparing for the Weekend</h4>
<P>Each member of the team has a part to play during the team meetings in building a cohesive team.  Teamwork is greatly enhanced when you:
<UL>
    <LI>Pray without ceasing for the candidates, team, their families, and the community.
    <LI>Attend team meetings.
    <LI>Know and prepare for your own team duties.
    <LI>Contribute to times of sharing.
    <LI>Make an effort to know team members.
    <LI>Familiarize yourself with the other team members' responsibilities.
    <LI>Provide support and assistance with agape love to teammates and candidates.
    <LI>Know the Rector is an imperfect person chosen by God to lead the weekend.
    <LI>Know the Rector operates under the authority of the Secretariat.
</UL>
<P>It is very important to bring to this team experience the same attitude you were asked to have when you made your Tres Dias weekend:
<UL>
    <li>Believe great things are possible.
    <LI>Have a spirit of openness to God for what He is asking of you.
    <LI>Have loving concern for one another and total trust in God.
</UL>

<h4>Participating in the Weekend</h4>
<P>The second shared task takes place during the Tres Dias weekend.  You are essential to the process of making the weekend effective.  Remember, you will be blessed most when you are serving with God's great love.  Some of the actions, which are helpful, include:
<ul>
    <LI>Learn as many of the candidate's names as possible.
    <LI>Be as available as possible to the candidates during breaks and off-hours.
    <LI>Be on time for events (including "lining the path")
    <LI>Wear your nametag.
    <LI>Observe the Silent Retreat time during the first evening.
    <LI>Share in the financial support of the weekend.
    <LI>Do the tasks assigned to you, and let others do theirs.
    <LI>Do not do special favors for candidate that are outside your area of service.
    <LI>Trust the Rector as God's chosen leader for the weekend.
</UL>

<h4>Celebrating the Weekend</h4>
<P>The final shared task is after the weekend at the Celebration Dinner.  This takes place soon after the weekend and is usually the last formal time the team and candidates will gather together as a group.  The purpose of this gathering is to review weekend experiences, celebrate with the candidates, and encourage them to share the transformation that has happened in their fourth day.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<P>To fulfill the assigned role on this team, a team member must:
<ul>
    <li>Know Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior.
    <LI>Have experienced a life-changing relationship with Jesus.
    <LI>Live a life in grace through regular fellowship with other Christians, as in a Reunion Group.
    <LI>Be on a pilgrimage toward Christian maturity and perfection.
</UL>
<P>The weekend is truly a team effort.  Each team member has a role to fulfill.  It is the team working, praying, and worshipping with Jesus that produces the Tres Dias weekend.  Welcome to the team!
